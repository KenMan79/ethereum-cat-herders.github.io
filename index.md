## About
The Ethereum Cat Herders are a group of independent contributors serving the Ethereum community. We are here to support Ethereum developer teams by coordinating Hard Forks, monitoring EIPs, creating PM processes and retroactive reports, relaying information between teams, taking notes during All Core Devs calls and much more.
