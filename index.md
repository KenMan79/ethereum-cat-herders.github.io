Welcome to the Ethereum cat Herders' website, the go-to place to get the latest news on upcoming Network Upgrades (Hard Forks), EIP's, announcements and overall core developer and community coordination efforts.

## About
The Ethereum Cat Herders are a group of independent contributors serving the Ethereum community. We are here to support Ethereum developer teams by coordinating Hard Forks, monitoring EIPs, creating PM processes and retroactive reports, relaying information between teams, taking notes during All Core Devs calls and much more.

**Our aim is to bring the minumum amount of order that chaos needs to move Ethereum forward.**
